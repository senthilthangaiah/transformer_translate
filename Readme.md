# German to English Translation using Transformers

This repository contains code to train a transformer model for translating German sentences to English using PyTorch and provides a Streamlit web application for inference.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/german-to-english-translation.git
   cd german-to-english-translation
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the necessary spaCy language models:

bash
Copy code
python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Training the Model
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This script will preprocess the data, train the transformer model, and save the trained model to transformer-model.pt.

Running the Streamlit App
To start the Streamlit app, run:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run translate_app.py
This will open a web browser with the translation interface where you can input German sentences and get English translations.
